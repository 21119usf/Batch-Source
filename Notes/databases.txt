* DATABASE - Data stored as entitites/tables with entries stored as rows
* RELATIONAL - there exists a relationship between A and B
* DIALECTS - Oracle, PostGreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, etc
* DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE - 
* RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
* TABLES - Contains columns and rows
* COLUMNS - Defines type (like parameters for an object)
* ROWS - Entries (like the object itself)
* PRIMARY KEY - Unique identifying column for a table
* FOREIGN KEY - Key to reference a column in another table
* COMPOSITE KEY - Type of PK; made up of multiple columns
* SURROGATE KEY - Generated value for the purpose of being a PK
* NATURAL KEY - Value naturally in the table used as a PK
* MULTIPLICITY/CARDINALITY - Defines relationship between fields/tables
    * 1-to-1
    * 1-to-n
    * n-to-n
* REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY - Consistency between tables when entries are changed
* NORMALIZATION - Removing redundencies in the database
    * 1st Normal Form
        * Data is stored in a relational table with PK
        * Each column contains atomic values
    * 2nd Normal Form
        * Table is in 1st Normal Form
        * Each column depends on the table's PK
    * 3rd Normal Form
        * Table is in 2nd Normal Form
        * All of its columns are not transitively dependent on the PK
* CRUD (Create Read Update Delete)
* SUB-LANGUAGES
    * DDL - Data Definition Languages
        * CREATE
            * CREATE TABLE A (int ID, VARCHAR(X) name);
            * Each VARCHAR can hold up to X characters
        * ALTER
            * ALTER TABLE DROP Column ID;
            * Dropped column ID, so only the name column is left
        * DROP
            * DROP TABLE A
            * No more Table A
        * TRUNCATE
            * Deleting data without deleting the table, maintains structure
            * Practical use - refreshing data daily
            * Import tables
    * DML - Data Manipulation Language
        * Insert
            * INSERT INTO A Values(14, 'Bob');
            * INSERT INTO A (ID), Values (15);
        * Update
            * UPDATE A SET name = 'Dale' WHERE ID = 14;
            * Modifies a row
        * Delete
            * DELETE FROM A WHERE name = 'Bob';
            * Deletes all rows in table where name is Bob
    * DQL - Data Query Language
        * SELECT
            * SELECT A FROM *
            * Returns table A
    * DCL - Data Control Language
        * GRANT
        * REVOKE
        * VIEW
            * Virtual table which can hide sensitive data
    * TCL - Transaction Control Language
        * COMMIT
            * Permanently save
        * SAVEPOINT
            * Temporary save point
        * ROLLBACK
            * Roll DB back to last commit or save point
* Built-in Datatypes
    * https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/sql_elements001.htm#i54330
* Order of SQL queries: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
* JOINS must have same number of columns and same type of data
* TRANSACTIONS - Units of work done on a database that may include many operations
    * TCL
        * Commit
        * Rollback
        * Savepoint
    * ACID
        * Atomicity - Smallest unit that can be run, all or nothing
        * Consistency - Database is in a valid state according to existing structure
        * Isolation - Concurrent transactions do not affect each other
        * Durability - Mandatory backups
    * Transactions Phenomenon
        * Dirty Read
        * Non-repeatable Read
        * Phantom Read
